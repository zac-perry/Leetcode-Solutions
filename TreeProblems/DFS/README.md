# DFS (Depth First Search)
Technique is defined by using backtracking for traversal. First, the deepest node is visited and then backtracks to its parent node if no slibling of that nodes exists. There are multiple types here (TODO, add others) 

## 1. Inorder Traversal
1. Traverse the left subtree
2. Visit the root
3. Traverse the right subtree

## 2. Preorder Traversal
1. Visit the root
2. Traverse the left subtree
3. Traverse the right subtree

## 3. Postorder Traversal
1. Traverse the left subtree
2. Traverse the right subtree
3. Visit the root
