# Two Pointer Problems
Approach used for traversing Linear Structures (arrays, linked-list, strings)
Instead of checking every combination of elements (O(n^2)), two pointers allows you to traverse much faster and often times in O(n) complexity.

## Two main methods
1. Same Direction
  - Ideal for problems where you are processing or scanning data in one pass
  - "Fast & Slow" pointer approach (Example: Linked List Cycle Detection)
2. Opposite Direction
  - Typically used for finding pairs or comparing elements from opposite ends of the data structure.
  - Example: Two Sum -> finding two numbers that sum up to a target. One pointer starts at the beginning, the other at the end.
